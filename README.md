# Quantum Maze Adventure

I made this small quantum-based game in my free time, inspired by concepts from quantum mechanics. The game is called **Quantum Maze Adventure**, and it revolves around navigating a maze while encountering quantum phenomena like superposition, teleportation, and quantum gates. The objective is to reach the exit while scoring points, but the game also includes twists like quantum tunnels and Hadamard gates to make it more interactive and engaging.

## Features

1. **Random Maze Generation**: Each playthrough generates a new maze layout, ensuring a fresh experience every time.
2. **Quantum Teleportation**: Special quantum gates (Quantum Tunnels) will teleport you to random parts of the maze, adding unpredictability.
3. **Superposition State**: Use Hadamard gates to enter a superposition, splitting your position into two locations in the maze until measured.
4. **Points System**: Gain points for each move, quantum interaction, and successfully navigating the maze.
5. **Health System**: Each move costs health, so you'll need to plan your movements wisely. Running out of health will result in a game over.
6. **Engaging Controls**: Move through the maze using the arrow buttons and interact with quantum gates and states to solve the puzzle.
7. **Quantum Mechanics Integration**: The game incorporates basic principles of quantum mechanics, including probabilistic outcomes and teleportation.

## Controls

- **Up/Down/Left/Right**: Move in the maze.
- **Measure**: Collapse the superposition if you enter one.
- **Quantum Tunnels**: Teleports you to random places in the maze.

The objective is to reach the exit while navigating through quantum phenomena. Good luck escaping the maze!

This was just a small project I made to experiment with quantum-inspired mechanics in a simple game format. Have fun!
